# skaarup.dev v2

For now it is just a portfolio site, but in the future it should also have links to projects I've worked on and am working on.

[Prod Site](https://skaarup.dev)

~~[Dev Site](https://dev.skaarup.dev)~~ (Not available at the moment, test in prod atm)

## Developing

Once you've cloned the repository and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun preview`.
