# skaarup.dev v2

For now it is just a portfolio site, but in the future it should also have links to projects I've worked on and am working on.

[Prod Site](https://skaarup.dev)

[Dev Site](https://dev.skaarup.dev)

## Developing

Once you've cloned the repository and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
